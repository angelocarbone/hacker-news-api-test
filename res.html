Over the past five years, Wealthfront has built a technology company focused on re-architecting the finance industry, and along the way we’ve created a new category known as automated investment services (aka ‘robo-advisors’, but truth be told we’re fairly light on robots). What that actually means is we build software that enables us to democratize access to services typically reserved for the ultra-wealthy, and through automation we can deliver those services to investors at an incredibly low cost. And it’s working; we have clients across the country who trust us with over $8 billion in assets -- and we’re just getting started!<p>We are hiring across the board, but are specifically looking for DevOps Engineers, iOS Engineers and Android Engineers.<p>Feel free to check out the job descriptions and apply here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;wealthfront" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;wealthfront</a> (please mention Hacker News in application).<hr/>Scalyr | Frontend, Backend Engineers | San Mateo, CA | ONSITE<p>I&#x27;ve built half a dozen startups, including Writely (aka Google Docs), and I can honestly say that Scalyr is my favorite so far.

And we&#x27;re doing it on a sane, 40-hour, daily-team-hike, Fridays-at-home schedule. We&#x27;re pre-series-A, but in many ways playing like a series B company, so this is a chance to get the best of both worlds -- early-stage equity and impact, with later-stage compensation and stability; plus a very strong team for peering or mentorship.<p>Backend Engineer: We&#x27;ve built a NoSQL data engine from scratch that searches text at 750 GB&#x2F;second.
